Description:
This was my final project in ICS3U complete with: an intelligent AI player, intro animation, sounds, "fancy" images, a main menu, options, instructions

I was going to add some battle animations and a leaderboard, but the due date was fast approaching so I spent my time on ironing out the bugs.

I've stopped development on this.
